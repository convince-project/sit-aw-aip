CONVINCE SIT-AW-AIP
===================

This project allows to use a VLM for anomaly identification. The deployment of the VLM is explained and the way to communicate with the model, given CONVINCE use cases. For now only UC1, vacuum cleaner, and UC2, assembly robot. The last section explains how to custom the communication.

The tests have been done only on LINUX.
